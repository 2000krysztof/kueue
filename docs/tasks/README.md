# Tasks

This section contains pages that show how to perform individual tasks.
A task page shows how to do an operation with a short sequence of steps.

The tasks are designed to be followed by two personas: _batch administrators_
and _batch users_.

## As a batch administrator

A _batch administrator_ manages the cluster infrastructure and establishes
quotas and queues.

## As a batch user

A _batch user_ runs [workloads](/docs/concepts/queued_workload.md). A typical
batch user is a researcher, AI/ML engineer, data scientist, among others.

### [Run Jobs](run_jobs.md)
